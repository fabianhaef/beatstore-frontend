      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>Amphibian.ch was founded in 2020 by three friends in Switzerland. We have been making music together for
                several years. Together we are a well-rehearsed team, in which each of us can play out his qualities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>For us amphibian.ch is a platform to express our love for music. We also welcome artists and other music producers in our studio to create music and vibe together.
